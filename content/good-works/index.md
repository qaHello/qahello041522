## Our Special Interests

* Our team has a long-time connection with the [San Francisco LightHouse for the Blind](https://lighthouse-sf.org/about/history/). We love the work they do with Enchanted Hills camp for the visually impaired, in Napa CA. So for us we can't think of a better way to help make the world a better place than to support them in uplifting the lives and experiences of blind children.

* [The Academy of Music for the Blind](https://www.facebook.com/ouramb/about/) (in So. CA.) is another organization that we're extremely jazzed about. We've already begun contributing, and have big plans around raising extensive additional funds to donate to their great cause.

* [Seva Foundation](https://www.seva.org/site/SPageServer/?NONCE_TOKEN=2E8DA5DAFA79DA35510F237A97A1C68F&pagename=Patient_Spotlight_Wendy_Guatemala) is an award winning organization saving sight and treating vision diseases and injuries in worthy communities in the U.S. and around the world. At QA Hello we feel a deep commitment to doing what we can to be a small part of the profound life-changing good works Seva orchestrates and carries out year after year.
